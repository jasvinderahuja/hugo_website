           -	Researched genetics of male infertility by co-managing two postdoctoral fellows and managing DNA sequencing and analysis in a project involving 20 medical centers globally.
           -	To improve identification of infertility-causing mutations, I employed methods for variant phasing, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, population sampling probabilities (PSAP) modeling using R, Python and high performance computing (HPC, similar to AWS) for data analysis and storage.
           -	Secured NIH funding ($70k) for functional analysis of causal mutations by presenting findings to National Institutes of Health.

            Most DNA breaks are repaired by homologous recombination (HR, which is scarless) including ones caused by modern therapeutic reagents like CRISPR-Cas9.
            
            Repair via HR can be easily studied using the physiological process of meiosis where chromosomal DNA inherited from mom and dad breaks and recombines leading to formation of gametes (egg and sperm). To achieve this, I-
            
            \- Designed 50 variants (~one string long) in a DNA span of 6Kb flanking a frequent DNA break site in the yeast model system. 
            
            \- Then I analyzed ~600 gametes per experiment where I extracted DNA and determined sequence combination of the 50 polymorphic markers (designed variants).
            
            \- Using sequencing >100M sequences (length = 150), >1200 molecules (length 6000) were reconstructed.
            
            \- Developed custom scripts in R, Python, and bash to determine combination of 50 variations among millions of DNA reads. 
            
            \- Wrote scalable code to run on Biowulf cluster at NIH (with >95,000 cores and RedHat Linux Enterprise). 
            
            In conclusion, based on our results we proposed a radically improved model for DNA repair via homologous recombination, where we found that DNA template selection is a dynamic and reversible process – published in Molecular Cell (2021).
            
            IMPACT: This research improved our understanding of how DNA from mom and dad is recombined before being packaged into sperm and egg.

            For my Ph.D., I explored the mechanisms that ensure inheritance of exactly one copy of genome via gametes (egg or sperm) which is vital for maintenance of two copies of genome among most eukaryotes including human beings. 
            
            IMPACT: We discovered that the protein degradation machinery localizes to chromosomes during meiosis and is essential for gamete formation. This discovery was published in top STEM journal Science (2017).
